# Example ~/.babybindsrc
#
# These lines are comments. Comments are whole lines and start with a #. Because they are whole lines, something like this:
# 114:echo The lower volume button was pressed! # I am the comment mentioned!
# ... will not count as a babybindsrc comment, as it will still be passed with the shell command
#
# Empty lines, spaces and tabs NOT in the shell command are ignored, so stuff like this can be done:
    # NESTED COMMENTS!
# The syntax for keybinds is:
# <keycode>;<keycode>;<keycode>;<...>:<shell command>
# (Note that you need at least one keycode, duh, and that a colon indicates the beginning of the shell command associated with the key combination)
# (... also, key combinations dont have an order, so beware!)
# Example:

115:amixer -q sset Master 5%+
# This will raise volume whenever the raise volume multimedia key is pressed on the keyboard, using alsamixer
